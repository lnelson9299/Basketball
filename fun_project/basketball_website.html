<h1>Greatest Basketball Players of All Time</h1>
	<p>This website is about the top 3 greatest basketball players of all time, <strong>IN MY OPINION</strong></p>
	<p>The players I choose will be based on statistics, championships, and teams. By teams I mean whether or not they were based around a super team or by themselves </p>
<h1>1. Lebron James</h1>
<p>Yes I am a Jordan fan but the table you will see, will prove to anyone that Lebron is the undisputed G.O.A.T. He has amazing stats and is currently still in the league at the age of 36&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see he is top 3 in points, top 10 in assists, and top 15 in steals.Also out of the 18 seasons he has played, 14 of them has involved him in the playoffs. These stats show that Lebron can play both sides of the ball. Now let's talk about the chamionship teams. He won his first two with the Miami Heat, during those chamionship runs, that team had some really good talent involving Lebron, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, and a very solid bench consisting of Shane Battier and Ray Allen. In the 2015-16 run, he had Kyrie Irving and a prime Kevin Love, who could shoot the ball. This team was no where near as good as the Miami Heat but still pretty good. In the finals the Cavaliers were down 3-1 with the championship on the line for every game. The Cavs managed to push it to a game 7 where Lebron and Kyrie played their hearts out to win. 2019-20 with the Lakers involved a solid team but with Anthony Davis and Lebron playing together. These two players carried the Lakers to finals and in the finals as well. I am not saying he did not deserve it but Anthony Davis was the biggest help to that run. All in all, Lebron has had some help to win these chamionships but you can not really win a championship without some sort of boost.</p>
<h1>2. Michael Jordan </h1>

<p>Michael Jordan was in the NBA for 15 years, almost all of those seasons were with the Chicago Bulls with his final season being with the Washington Wizards. During his time with the Bulls, he racked up 6 championships. It is not a surprise that Jordan had help to win his championships, just like Lebron. Scottie Pippen was a huge help to Jordan when you talk about regular season or playoffs. I think the bulls would have had two to three more championships if Michael Jordan did not retire in 93 and 95. It was a high chance that Jordan would have more points than Lebron and with the possibility of more championships, that would have solidified him as the Greatest of All Time. </p>
<p>Before I get to number 3, I would like to list some honorable mentions. Kobe Bryant, Bill Russell, and Magic Johnson.</p>
<h1>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h1>
<p><img src="file:///D|/kareem.jpg" width="348" height="297" alt=""/></p>
<p>I am not putting Kareem here because he is the scoring leader, I am putting him here for other accolades like championships, MVPs, etc.</p>

<p>Even though Kareem is higher in almost every stat category, you have to think about how hard the NBA has developed since Kareem's days. Back in the 70s, it was pretty easy being a big, versatile man. Kareem had all sorts of tricks to score, which is why he is number 1 all time in scoring. His signature sky-hook shot would be almost automatic everytime he went to shoot it, all because of his length. All of his championships did involve an icon of the league, for example in Milwaukee there was Oscar Robertson who fed Kareem the ball a countless amount of times and in Los Angeles, the icon there was Magic Johnson who was also known as a great passer. But I will say it again, almost all of the greats with a championship had some sort of help, but it is what is needed.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Lebron James based on placement of stats, championship teams, and overall play during his career has proven to the NBA that he is the greatest of all time</li>
  <li>Michael Jordan he right up there with Lebron on placement of stats but in a couple categories Lebron has proven to be better</li>
  <li>Kareem is the top scorer of all time but looking at the time he played in and being as big as him, made it pretty easy to score points&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
